## Cryptography Schemes  

### RSA Cryptography Scheme  

I implemented a version of the RSA Cryptography scheme. RSA was named after R.L. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman who laid out the system in their paper ["A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf) from 1977. It relies on the difficulty in factoring large primes in order to prevnt people from breaking the security, and it is no longer particularly secure today, due to advancements in computing. When using RSA to encrypt messages each participant generates a private a public key. The message is sent using the recipient's public key and can then be decrypted using their private key. RSA keys are generated by first generating two large prime numbers, p and q. These prime numbers are mulitplied together in order to calculate n which is part of the public key. d and e are calculated with the help of the extended form of euclids algorithm such that when encrypting with the public key e and n, the public key d and n may be used to decrypt.

### Diffie Hellman Key Exchange   

I implemented a version of the Diffie Helman key exchange. The Diffie Hellman key exchange is a method by which two parties can establish a shared secret, without needing to transmit it directly. The scheme was originally published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman in their paper ["New Directions in Cryptography"](https://ee.stanford.edu/%7Ehellman/publications/24.pdf) from 1976. To begin the Diffie Hellman key exchange both parties must agree on both a prime number and a generator value. The generator value should be a prime root for the prime number that was agreed upon. Then both participants select their private keys. These private keys are then used with the agreed upon prime and generator in order to calculate the public keys. These public keys are then exchanged and each participant can use their own private key and the other participant's public key in order to calculate a shared secret value. As anyone intercepting messages would not have access to either participant's private keys, it would be computationally difficult to generate the same shared secret.

### Caesar Cypher  

The caesar cypher is a very simple example of a cypher which relies on shifting every character in a message the same number of places in the alphabet. For example if you were to encrypt "def" with a multiplcation value of four the result would be "hij". The idea is that, without the knowing the shift value, it is harder to find the original message. However, since the cypher is limited by the number of letters in the alphabet, it is trivial to brute force.

### Multiplicative Cypher  

The multiplicative cypher is also a very simple example of a cypher. It relies on multiplying every character in a message by the same value before calculating the modulus. For example if you were to encrypt "def" with a shift value of four the result would be "mqu". The idea is that, without the knowing the multiplication value, it is harder to find the original message. While it relies on more calculation than the caesar cypher, the multiplicative cypher is still limited by the number of letters in the alphabet, it is also trivial to brute force.
