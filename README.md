## Cryptography Schemes  

### RSA Cryptography Scheme  

I implemented a version of the RSA Cryptography scheme. RSA was named after R.L. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman who laid out the system in their paper "[A Method for Obtaining Digital
Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)" from 1977. It relies on the difficulty in factoring large primes in order to prevnt people from breaking the security, and it is no longer particularly secure today, due to advancements in computing. When using RSA to encrypt messages each participant generates a private a public key. The message is sent using the recipient's public key and can then be decrypted using their private key. RSA keys are generated by first generating two large prime numbers, p and q. These prime numbers are mulitplied together in order to calculate n which is part of the public key. d and e are calculated with the help of the extended form of euclids algorithm such that when encrypting with the public key e and n, the public key d and n may be used to decrypt.
